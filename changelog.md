# GAMEMODE 2018.12.22.01
- The OpenShift servers seems to have been experiencing some severe connection issues.
- Fortunately, today I've received a $50 donation. Donations like these will keep the game going, and even the smallest donations can still have an impact.

# GAMEMODE 2018.12.17.01
- Unfortunately, the US West server ran out of bandwidth for this month.
- OpenShift has announced that from now on, old projects will expire in 30 days, while new projects expire 60 days after they were created. This means that from now on, the US East servers will need to be remade every two month.
- In order to keep all of the servers up at all time, you can donate to me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/arras">Patreon</a> so I can upgrade the US West server to have more bandwidth.

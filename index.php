I recognize the possible risk involved for my child in participating in online activities, including risks associated with online piracy, security, and invasion of privacy.

	<p>Camper Code of Conduct:<br>Our hope is that Christian Heights Camp will be a place for campers to make friends and find support.<br>In order for Christian Heights Camp to be safe, fun and enjoyable for everyone, there are some expectations to discuss with your child.<br> 1. I will choose the golden rule while at Christian Heights Camp.<br> 1. Alcoholic beverages, illegal drugs, smoking or tobacco products are not allowed during the hours of virtual camp. Christian Heights Camp has the right to remove a camper from the Zoom meeting without warning if the Camp Director suspects these products have been used.<br>3. Sexual or suggestive behavior/comments/conversations is not appropriate or acceptable at Christian Heights Camp.<br>4. Campers will only use the Zoom platform to contact camp staff and fellow campers during the scheduled camp times..<br> 5. Screen shots, recording, and private, separate chats are not allowed during virtual camp sessions.<br> 6. My background will be appropriate, such as, but not limited to, a blank wall, virtual background image, or pictures appropriate for camp.<br>7. I will follow the guidelines for appropriate chat conversations.<br>a. If you ever feel uncomfortable, tell your trusted adult<br>b. No secrets. (Surprises are different. Surprises make us feel good and are intended to share eventually. Secrets are not ever meant to share and can feel bad.)<br>c. Good messages are ones that parents/guardians are excited to see and hear and the person sharing it with you would want your parents/guardians to see and hear the message.<br> d. Cussing, swearing and foul language is not acceptable at Christian Heights Camp. <br> Electronic signature of this page shows you understand, agree, and consent with the above stated cost, resources needed, acknowledgements, general release and camper code of conduct.</p>
